# Distance-Based Neural Networks (GPC)

A novel approach to neural computation through geometric transformations.

## Abstract

This repository contains the research on distance-based interpretation of neural networks. A 4.2KB model containing only 44 position vectors in 16-dimensional space successfully performs arithmetic calculations up to 16 trillion without using traditional arithmetic operators.

## Key Results

- **Model Size**: 4.2KB (5,411 bytes)
- **Computational Range**: -10¹³ to 10¹³
- **Accuracy**: >99.99% within training range
- **Key Innovation**: All computations are performed as movements in geometric space

## Model

The trained model is available in the `models/` directory:
- `gpc.pt` (4.2KB)

## Paper

Full paper: [Coming soon on Zenodo]

## Core Principles

1. **Intentional Overfitting**: Each number has a fixed position
2. **Position Fixing**: Knowledge never forgets
3. **Distance-Based Learning**: No arithmetic operators used
4. **Unidirectional Information Flow**: New knowledge doesn't affect existing knowledge
